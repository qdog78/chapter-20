        Born on the southside of Chicago, I studied at Western Illinois
        University. Finished with my degree in law enforcement, after getting a
        career in law enforcement and handling all of the stresses of being an
        LEO I decided to become a software developer. I hope you enjoy my
        portfolio assignment!!!
